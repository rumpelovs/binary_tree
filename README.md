### What's it?

###### This is a binary tree. A binary tree is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node can have a maximum of two descendants (left and right). It is used for efficient data storage and retrieval, especially when the data has a hierarchical structure.

### Why do I need a binary tree:

#### 1. Search: Binary tree provides efficient element search. Due to the ordering property of elements in the tree, you can quickly determine in which part of the tree the desired element is located, and continue searching only in this part.

#### 2. Insert and Delete: The binary tree makes it easy to add and remove elements. When a new element is added, it is placed in the appropriate place of the tree, preserving its order. When an element is deleted, the tree is rebuilt in such a way as to preserve its properties.

#### 3. Sorting: A binary tree can be used to sort items. When traversing the tree in ascending or descending order, you can get a sorted list of elements.

#### 4. Other operations: The binary tree also supports other operations, such as searching for the smallest and largest elements, searching for the next or previous element, etc.

### In general, a binary tree is an important data structure that allows you to efficiently store, search and process data, especially when they are hierarchical in nature.
